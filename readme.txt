# Project Name

## Summary
The firmware uses a microphone to make and LED strip audio reactive. The purpose of this project was to challenge myself to code with Ubuntu server on
a Raspberry PI with no UI, just the terminal, to gain more experience with possibly not using UI in future careers. I designed the different
reactive modes of the LED strip using various Python libraries I installed.
